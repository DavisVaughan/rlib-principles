# rlib-principles

Principles for a theoretical C library, rlib, which would contain tooling for building R packages with C code, developed using [Lionel Henry's rlang lib/](https://github.com/r-lib/rlang/tree/master/src/lib) as the initial framework to build off of. This is simply a place to hash out ideas, and develop a common set of principles to build the library on. Eventually it could become a bookdown like [tidyverse principles](https://principles.tidyverse.org/) that we can reference back to when design questions come up during development.
